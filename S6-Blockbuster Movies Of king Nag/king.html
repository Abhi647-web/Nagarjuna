    <h2 id="sR">Sri Hari</h2>
    <p id="srihariDescription">Srihari was born in 1964 in Elamarru near Gudivada in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh.[1] His parents moved to Hyderabad and settled in Balanagar, when he was still a child. He started his career as a stunt fighter. He was also an athlete in gymnastics. He was offered jobs such as sub-inspector of police and railway officer, but he rejected those offers because he was interested in pursuing an acting career.

        Srihari completed his degree in 1986. He was introduced into movies by Dasari Narayana Rao with a role in the movie Brahma Nayudu (1987).

Novelist and playwright Adi Vishnu introduced him to NCV Sashidhar of Doordarshan (DD). Soon after, he made his television debut in 1985 with DD Telugu's Pakapakalu.[11][12] His performance in the show received good response from the audience.[13] After watching his performance in the show, director Jandhyala cast him in the film Aha Naa-Pellanta!
